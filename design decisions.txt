bug lists:

1. preserving edits (update)
	1. when nav link name is changed
	2. when name section, pic section or about section is changed
	3. when should the contents be preserved?
		-> should it be preserved every time nav is changed?
		-> should it be only presearved when it has been edited?
		-> reveal contents when closed; should database be updated?
2. create
	1. adding new nav link
	2. when to save name of new nav link 
	3. adding placeholder content for easy edit 
3. delete
	1. how to delete nav link and its associated contents? should confirmation pop up appear?




possible repurcussions: 

1. What if nav is deselected and then again seleted in a small time span. If we are only saving
   the edits when the nav is changed, it can cause problemns. Since, the cache data will only update
   after the database has been updated which is asynchoronous task. The view might show the old 
   inconsistent data from the cache.




Idea for preserving edits:

1. Whenever a content is changed; note that under navlink name.
2. In the meantime if navlink itself is modified; note that under the old navlink name.
3. navlink should hold things like:
   eg: 
		navlink = "research"
		toPreserveContents = "true"
		newName = "amazing research"
4. When nav tab is about to change check if the nav has dirty edits that needs to be saved.
5. If admin mode is about to be turned off and there are dirty edits which hasn't been saved 
   then first preserve those before switching admin mode.
