![image](/assets/images/tic_tac_toe/tic_tac_toe.png){:height="500px"}


Yesterday i was bored as hell. With nothing particular to do, this semester break seemed pretty dull. I was lying in the bed bored and lazy. And out of nowhere i came up with the idea of making game. I decided on Tic Tac Toe and started laying my game plan. Within few hours i would have a playable game in front of me.

History repeats itself. Here i am bored again with no idea what to do. So i decided to share the game i made yesterday along with the code. :)

Tech used: Html5 Canvas, javascript.
